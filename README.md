### CORPORATE SECTOR:
In this fast and quick world ,getting your resumes acustomedly designed for each and every job
manually is not feasible and very time consuming .Let’s take an example: A person who has a
past experience as a teacher(say social science) and also a part time software developer.
Now take a situation that person has applied for a post at school for a position of primary class
social science teacher.To get this job he/she needs a strong CV showing off their skills and
education in the background of social science,whereas if he/she applies for the post of
SDK1(Software Developer) the point of emphasising their skills in the field of Social science
won’t make a difference,vis-a-vi a stronghold skills in the field of software development will
increase their chance to get the job.
So an all in one platform that would provide you a custom made CV based on your skill set and
emphasise your skills required as per the job would be really helpful to a job seeking person.
